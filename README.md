# Brain-Tumor-Detection
A Python-based brain tumor detection application, leveraging computer vision and image processing techniques. Built using OpenCV for image manipulation, Tkinter for the graphical user interface, NumPy for numerical computations, and PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image handling, this project aims to detect and analyze brain tumors from MRI scans.
